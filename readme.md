# K Nearest Neighbour with Cross Validation.
### Author: Daniel Pullon

This application uses a dataset of values that correspond to different traits that may be present in particular wines.
The algorithm will use these traits to test a set of data against another set of training data and determine the class (or type of wine) that each test row is most likely to be.
The result of the algorithm is then checked against the actual result and a score is given.

### There are 2 OPTIONAL arguments that can be supplied to the program.

1. int - Number for kNearest. Default is 3.

2. int - Number of groups for cross validation. Default is 7.
